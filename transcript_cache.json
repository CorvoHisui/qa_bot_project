    "we'll typically take a detour towards",

    "if you have enough friendship on a",
    "Pokémon you'll receive a lucky egg as a",

    "Y with the best known strategies got",
    "really bored Well sometimes that's",
    "exactly what you need to revolutionize a",
    "speedrun And the one to do it was none",

    "Bob Pokemon speedrunner Headbob is not",
    "only the X and Y world record holder but",
    "is also the undisputed king of Nintendo",
    "3DS Pokemon speedruns holding the record",

    "friendship Yeah Well it's not just a",
    "random amount of friendship It's the",
    "maximum amount of friendship points",
    "possible at",
    "255 friendship points And earning",
    "friendship in a Pokémon game is quite",
    "difficult in a speedrun setting where",
    "you don't have every item method or",

    "picture this particular situation You're",
    "1 hour into speedrunning Pokémon X and Y",
    "with one of the best runs you've ever",
    "had in your life But every little bit of",
    "time save you've acquired could be lost",

    "unfortunately for you it doesn't show up",
    "until after four different encounters So",
    "you lose a bit of time But now that it",
    "showed up you have to catch it",
    "specifically in a luxury ball because",
    "any other Pokeball available will not",
    "give you anywhere near enough friendship",
    "points along the way So you whack it",
    "once with a move to get a better catch",
    "rate And if you hit it even one more",
    "time it'll die leaving you with no",
    "choice but to hope it gets in the ball",
    "on the next turn",
    "[Music]",
    "Truly there's no real right choice here",
    "when it comes to finding and catching a",
    "lucha in an X and Y speedrun because the",
    "odds of all of this coming together are",
    "incredibly low just like the odds of",
    "getting the 255 friendship points by the",
    "time you earn the fifth gym badge While",
    "you do have reliable methods like",
    "leveling up using items and",
    "participating in gym leader battles the",
    "RNGbased friendship gaining methods that",
    "are absolutely required to get there",
    "make things even more frustrating With",
    "one such method being the low odds you",
    "have of getting a good massage in Salage",
    "City as not every massage you get is",
    "created equally And while we do have the",
    "ability to get more than one massage at",
    "a time getting multiple five friendship",
    "massages in a row is extremely",
    "devastating So when Head Bob decided to",
    "do a No Lucky Egg speedrun for fun it",
    "raised a few eyebrows when he managed to",
    "get a run that was only 6 minutes behind",
    "the world record Then not even 2 days",
    "later he got another that was only 3",
    "minutes behind the world record It would",
    "be at this point that Headb started to",
    "question everything we relied on for the",
    "past 10 years to the point where he",
    "couldn't help but ask \"Is this actually",
    "as good as it seems?\" And after",
    "double-checking with other top runners",
    "before eventually releasing his findings",
    "it wouldn't take long until more people",
    "wanted to try it more people were",
    "getting personal best and eventually the",
    "3DS king head Bob himself got a run that",
    "was less than 30 seconds away from",
    "beating the X and Y world record",
    "signaling to the community that the No",
    "Lucky Egg Revolution was no longer just",
    "for fun but had the real potential to be",
    "faster But how much faster exactly Where",
    "would we end up saving time And if the",
    "Lucky Egg was no longer giving us a ton",
    "of experience would the lack of extra",
    "levels throughout the story make it an",
    "even more miserable game to speedrun",
    "Well the answer to that wouldn't take",
    "long to find out as Head Bob would get",
    "on yet another amazing run on March 12th",
    "of 2025",
    "Really quickly just wanted to say that",
    "if you like what you're watching you",
    "should consider subscribing as I have a",
    "lot of videos like this one We put a lot",
    "of work into them Headbob would begin",
    "this X and Y run by setting his 3DS",
    "clock to be late at night pick the",
    "fastest in-game options available then",
    "perform the typical Pokémon main",
    "switches X and Y is known for And by the",
    "time he passed the first gym Head Bob",
    "would start to gain a lead on the lucky",
    "egg world record Since friendship was no",
    "longer a necessity on the no lucky egg",
    "route Headbop could save time on all the",
    "different moments a lucky egg route",
    "needed to go into buildings talk to",
    "people and use items whose only purpose",
    "was to increase friendship And the ever",
    "growing time save wouldn't just stop",
    "there As Headbot was skipping more and",
    "more things that the Lucky Egg route",
    "relied on and even got a bit luckier on",
    "a few rundefining areas and fights where",
    "the most defining shift in strategy",
    "would happen was the moment that Head",
    "Bob took his first steps into Salage",
    "City While Hadob would lose a bit of",
    "time from entering an extra Pokémon",
    "inside of Salage City that wasn't",
    "present in the Lucky Egg route in the",
    "grand scheme of things the amount of",
    "time this lost was quite minimal",
    "Especially when you realize exactly how",
    "much of an explosive change going into",
    "this march would shake up the landscape",
    "of Pokemon X and Y speedruns forever",
    "The Dusk Ball is a Pokeball that has",
    "proved to be one of the greatest",
    "Pokeballs ever created for catching even",
    "the most legendary of Pokémon But more",
    "importantly for the X and Y speedrunning",
    "community not needing to grab the lucky",
    "egg meant we no longer needed a luxury",
    "ball to catch Hawlucha in increasing the",
    "odds of a successful catch from 20 to",
    "40% on average to a minimum of 50% at",
    "full HP And as an added bonus the moment",
    "Headb caught one with a dust ball he",
    "could go directly to the gym and",
    "challenge it instead of banking on the",
    "awful 26% odds to get a good massage",
    "adding a crazy amount of consistency to",
    "the two worst sections in a Pokémon X",
    "and Y speedrun But where this part of",
    "the route would add consistency things",
    "started to look rough for the rest of",
    "the game for Head Bob Because as I",
    "stated before not having that lucky egg",
    "would affect the amount of extra levels",
    "we get along the way So even though the",
    "most frustrating parts of the run were",
    "fixed the same needed to be said for",
    "everything past the fifth gym But where",
    "the lucky egg seemed to overshadow the",
    "potential any other item had for Lucario",
    "the solution to not having it was",
    "actually in plain sight",
    "When the Loki item was the main star of",
    "the show it became mandatory for Lucario",
    "to hold on to it until the end of the",
    "game since unequipping it meant less",
    "experience making Mega Evolution seem",
    "like a pretty slow alternative with its",
    "super slow animations But surprisingly",
    "those animations weren't as slow as we",
    "thought as Headbop would soon find out",
    "that areas where you would take more",
    "than two turns to KO with Pokemon were",
    "actually sped up by mega evolution And",
    "even with the lower levels Head Bob",
    "wouldn't actually need to mega evolve",
    "for every single battle outside of 12",
    "separate fights at least when the route",
    "was first theorized But the moment Head",
    "Bob was getting closer and closer to a",
    "new world record and more and more",
    "people were playing X and Y again ideas",
    "started to be thrown around to try and",
    "involve other items And one such idea",
    "for an item came from Pokemon",
    "speedrunning legend war tab to take",
    "advantage of the held item black belt",
    "When a Pokemon holds on to the black",
    "belt item the power of your fighting",
    "moves is increased by an incredibly",
    "substantial 20% But in order for the",
    "item to be worth it it would have to be",
    "easy to obtain and worth equipping in",
    "the first place But as fate would have",
    "it the black belt item was not only easy",
    "to obtain and made a ton of fights",
    "faster but it also gave Headb the",
    "ability to shave off three mandatory",
    "mega evolutions along the way So with",
    "the power of the community coming",
    "together to finalize the no- lucky egg",
    "route all Headbob would need now is to",
    "survive the last half of the game with",
    "less levels than ever before and hope",
    "that all the time it took for the world",
    "record to get friendship points would be",
    "enough to keep his one minute lead after",
    "the fifth gym",
    "[Music]",
    "Head Bob's one minute lead was beginning",
    "to shake up a bit as he was entering",
    "areas of the game where higher levels",
    "really made a difference enough of a",
    "difference that the lucky egg route was",
    "a whopping seven levels higher than he",
    "was now But every timesaving method ever",
    "used in a speedrun is one that needs to",
    "give more than it takes And where the",
    "lucky egg has given us more power and",
    "survivability through experience we're",
    "now in a reality where the lucky egg",
    "we've relied on for the past 10 years",
    "takes just long enough to go into extra",
    "buildings get extra levels and equip",
    "extra items for friendship that it's",
    "considered slower by nearly an entire",
    "minute of time save And with this fun",
    "amazing new strategy Head Bob not only",
    "beat the previous X and Y record but he",
    "was able to break through the next",
    "minute barrier with a",
    "338 giving us a monumental run that'll",

    "savathun used her guise as osiris to maneuver us \nthrough politics and cabal's ceremony to arrive at  ",
